## 🔐 Safety + Smart Delay System

We’ve built a **robust AI safety model** for transaction control:

- Sensitive commands are **rate-limited** and verified  
- Execution is **auto-paused** if:
  - Gas fees are too high  
  - Network congestion is detected  
  - Price slippage is risky  

Every execution is **monitored, simulated, and controlled** in real-time.
