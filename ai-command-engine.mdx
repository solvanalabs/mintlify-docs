# 🧠 AI Command Engine

Wen AI is powered by a lightweight, modular AI system built to **understand intent**, **parse actions**, and **route them to execution endpoints** — all in real-time, across **web and Twitter**.

---

## ✨ Natural Command Parsing

Wen AI understands:

- 🗣 Plain English
- 💸 `$cashtags`
- 🔤 Emoji shortcuts
- 🐦 Twitter syntax

### 📌 Examples
- @WenAI swap 1 ETH to $WEN on Uniswap
- bridge 50 USDC to Base
- deploy ERC20 with name WENAI and 1B supply

---

## 🧩 Modular Execution Runners

Wen AI dynamically selects from:

- 💱 **Swaps:** Uniswap, 1inch, PancakeSwap  
- 🌉 **Bridges:** Stargate, Hop, Across  
- 🧬 **Deployments:** OpenZeppelin contract templates  
- 🎁 **Token Distribution** modules  
- ⏱ **Scheduling** & automation agents  

Each module is plug-and-play — built for **multi-chain** and **multi-protocol** support.


## 🛡️ Safety, Context & Constraints

Wen AI applies smart checks:

- ✅ Wallet & token approvals  
- ⛽ Gas limits  
- 💧 Slippage tolerance  
- 🛑 Risk prompts for unknown tokens  

You can add constraints like:

- `Only if gas < 30 gwei`
- `Only after 6PM UTC`
- `Run this every Monday`

Wen AI learns and adapts — it **remembers your preferences**, favorite chains, and trading styles.



AI isn’t just smart — it’s Wen smart ⚡
