# 🏛 DAO Governance

Wen AI is built **for the people, by the people** — and our governance system ensures it stays that way. Holders of **Genesis NFTs** and future **governance tokens** will have true power to shape the direction of Wen AI.

## 🧱 DAO Structure

- 📝 **Proposal Creation:**  
  Anyone with governance tokens can draft and submit proposals.

- 🗳 **Voting Rights:**  
  Voting power is weighted based on the number of tokens held.

- 🔗 **On-chain Execution:**  
  Once approved, proposals are automatically executed via smart contracts — handling key updates, treasury moves, and new feature rollouts.

## 🔄 What Can Be Voted On?

- Feature requests for Wen AI tools and open-source framework  
- Strategic partnerships and integrations  
- Core upgrades to the Wen AI Protocol

Governance is more than voting — it's community vision turned into action.
